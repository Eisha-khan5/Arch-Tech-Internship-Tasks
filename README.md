## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Plant Disease Classification**
- Built a **deep learning model** to detect and classify plant diseases using a labeled dataset of leaf images.  
- Utilized the **Plant Pathology Dataset** from Kaggle (~186,000 images) labeled with diseases such as rust, scab, and more complex conditions.  
- Preprocessed image data and applied **data augmentation** to improve model robustness.  
- Leveraged architectures such as **VGG-16, ResNet, and Inception** with **transfer learning** to enhance performance.  
- Evaluated model accuracy and tested predictions on sample images to ensure reliability.

### **Task 2: CIFAR-10 Object Recognition Using ResNet50**
- Built an **object recognition model** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
- Fine-tuned the **pre-trained ResNet50 architecture** for image classification.  
- Preprocessed dataset to match ResNet50 input requirements and applied **data augmentation**.  
- Trained the model to classify images into **10 object categories**.  
- Evaluated model accuracy and tested predictions on sample images to verify performance.
